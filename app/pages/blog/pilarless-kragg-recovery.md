This is a how-to and review of applications for recovering without using pillar as Kragg. Pillarless recovery utilizes the side B cancel activated by pressing the dodge button during the first 15 frames after pressing side B. Even though the animation is identical to the one used for an up B without pillar, you do not need to hold the control stick up at all to do this cancel. The best method for this is to hold the stick dead horizonal and press B and dodge in quick succession.

Generally, when Kragg is low offstage he has to use his pillar. Wall pillar is easily the best place to put it, and the best defense against a low wall pillar is to camp the ledge with hitboxes to hit kKagg off when he tries to come back on, bait an airdodge, or simply stall for time as the pillar sinks to increasingly unrecoverable levels for the Kragg. Going for a quick pillarless recovery in a situation where they choose to camp onstage for your wall pillar can throw them off and give you a free route back on. If you still have double jump and airdodge after making your walljump, you can recover onto platforms as well.

Another method to deal with low pillars is to run off, wait for the pillar, and smack Kragg into the wall. This is generally a poor option due to teching, but some characters can still make it work. If it looks like your opponent is dead set on forcing the tech situation, a surprise pillarless recovery may come in handy to throw them off. Since they're patiently waiting for your wall pillar, doing something completely different will give you ample time to land on stage and turn the edgeguard around before they can adjust. Sometimes they can even commit HARD for the pillar and die off the bottom when you don't do it.

Lastly, since the cancel out of side B uses the dodge button, you can use it to tech! This is great if they're trying to hit you against the wall to stop either your pillar or pillarless, and you can turn things around quickly.

The primary strength of pillarless recovery is surprise factor. If they expect it, you will get hit back offstage without pillar and probably die. But when used sparingly, or just as a quick way to get back onstage when your opponent is unable to respond, it can work out very well. If Kragg is caught without pillar, jump, or dodge and FORCED to use pillarless recovery, then it’ll take some luck to survive. 

The general method of recovering without any resources is to do a side B cancel into the wall, then walljump and immediately side B cancel again towards the stage. Using pillarless Up B in this scenario is completely obsolete when compared to the side B cancel, and the first step to learning these recoveries would be phasing pillarless up B out of your play entirely. 

Kragg’s only DI option while doing this recovery is inwards, so scooping this method with combo starters and going for the kill will put that stock to bed. However, if your opponent is slow with their combo you can land onstage anyway. I’ve seen plenty of Kragg players lose stocks thanks to not knowing how to do the side B cancel -> walljump -> side B cancel. Don’t let it happen to you!

So you may think "ok, but can't you just jump at them or charge a smash at the ledge if you see they're going to have to do pillarless recovery?"

Not quite! In addition to the high recovery mixup linked during the intro to this, you can also use your side B to plow through charged smashes or aerial approaches. From the side B hit you can combo right into a stage carry and turn the situation around completely. This supplies yet another mixup layer for them to have to consider.
