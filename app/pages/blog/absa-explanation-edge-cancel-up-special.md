When you edge cancel an up special, you will actually get both your double jump and your airdodge back!

In the gif below, you'll see that before I edge cancelled my up special, I burned both my double jump and my airdodge. After I edge cancelled my up special, you'll notice that I have my double jump and airdodge back! 


Hopefully this information will come in handy!
