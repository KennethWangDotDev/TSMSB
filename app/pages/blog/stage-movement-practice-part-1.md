When practicing stage movement, there are two things that I find to be the most important above all else:

* Break it down into steps at the beginning of learning something new.
* Have smaller practice sessions more often over longer practice sessions less often.

This first part will discuss the simplest yet most powerful stage movement technique, wavelanding into a platform drop aerial. Before I go into detail on each portion, I'll explain why it's so useful. Wavelanding on a platform gives you a quick burst of horizontal movement which is good for approaching, dropping from a platform lets you carry horizontal momentum to fall at your opponent with an aerial or special.

With these two simple ideas, you can mixup your approach timing severely for your opponent to consider the following:

* Will you fastfall or not?
* Are you going to land in front of, above, or behind me?
* Are you going to miss on purpose to punish a baited parry?

I've broken down this advanced stage movement technique into smaller portions:

<ul style="list-style: none!important">
<li><strong>1.</strong> Perfect wavelanding (horizontal)</li>
<li><strong>2.</strong> Buffering a dash out of your waveland</li>
<li><strong>3.</strong> Platform dropping [during your dash]</li>
<li><strong>4.</strong> Performing an aerial without accidentally fastfalling</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="margin-top">Misc Notes</h2>

Dashing isn't necessary when you're first starting out, but it's very useful. When your character dashes and leaves the ground, you'll get a burst of momentum. This can happen by either dashing near the edge of a platform/the stage and falling off before your run animation starts or by platform dropping. If you dash after you waveland, you'll retain that dash momentum when you platform drop.


A lot of people compliment me for my stage movement, or at least are aware that that's one of the few things I'm most known for. For me personally it took me about half a year practicing for 5 minutes each night before I went to sleep. Not every way to practice will work for everyone, but I personally recommend quick sessions every now and then over a long period of time to build muscle memory for it.
