We haven't had a tier list discussion in a while so I figured it's about time. I want to preface my tier list by saying that it is *not* based on theoretic and potential character skill ceiling. For example, in theory, an Orcane that plays perfectly will never lose to an Etalus that also plays perfectly. But humans aren't perfect, and at Genesis 4, the current best Etalus player defeated the current best Orcane player. Instead, this "current meta" tier list suggests the strengths of each character based on the top players for each character. It aims for realism over theoretics.

<h1 class="tier">**Tier S**:</h1>
<h2 class="character">WRASTOR</h2>
<h3 class="power-level">Power Level: 9082</h3><h3 class="quote">"I am bird man... fear me."</h3>

Wrastor making the top of this list should be no surprise to anyone. Wrastor is just way too goddamn good. He is fast, his moves have good frame data, and he has good punishes and kill potential. But it's balanced because he is very hard to play, right? Since he is so light so he dies early... right? NO, WRONG! IT ACTUALLY MAKES HIM HARDER TO KILL. HE CAN LITERALLY JUST DI OUT ON EVERY MOVE AND HIS OPPONENT CAN'T FOLLOWUP SINCE HE GOES FARTHER. IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER IF HE GOES OFFSTAGE BECAUSE HE HAS 4 JUMPS. HOLY FUCKING SHIT I HATE WRASTOR SO GODDAMN MUCH! FUCK! Anyway, Wrastor is literally the definition of a perfect character. He has no flaws.


<h2 class="character spacing">MAYPUL</h2>
<h3 class="power-level">Power Level: 8293</h3><h3 class="quote">"Are you stupid? I didn't prepare those for you. I-I just happened to have accidently made some extra food this morning, b-baka!"</h3>

Maypul is the other "power player" in this anime. She is a freaking *racecar*. When I play against her, I literally need to put on my glasses so my eyes can track her movement. At every instance in time, she just has so many options. Her combo game is brutal, and her edgeguard and recovery are also top-notch. In the official story, Maypul is the girl in your class who has the top 5 highest test scores in the nation, who also happens to be the most beautiful girl in the class. She never talks to you and always acts cold towards you, but secretly she has a crush on you that started from a subtle encounter when you two were both kids. Through certain circumstances, you two were stuck together in the same underbudget and dying club that you two work together to save. A beautiful relationship blossoms throughout the series that makes Studio Ghibli films seem stoic in comparison. Actually, disregard everything I said before I started talking about the anime, I'm putting Maypul as #2 solely to her perfect character arc and the way she calls me *b-baka~!!*

<hr class="hr">

<h1 class="tier">**Tier A**:</h1>

<h2 class="character">ETALUS</h2>
<h3 class="power-level">Power Level: 7927</h3><h3 class="quote">"I'm gonna fuck you up."</h3>

Wait what? *Etalus* is on the top of Tier A? What is this, a joke tier list? But hear me out. Etalus may not have the best fighting technique. Etalus may not have the highest ki level. But do you know what Etalus does have? A Masters Degree in Furry Animal Anatomy. That's right, Etalus knows every secret and weak point to the furry animal body. If you slip up even one single time and let Etalus get to you, he is going to FUCKING MURDER YOU AND LITERALLY RIP YOUR GUTS OUT. Who cares about power level when your opponent has a knife and is aiming for your throat. And in this case, the knife is an analogy for his killer claws. Etalus is a fatass by all means, but he is a fatass to be reckoned with.


<h2 class="character spacing">ZETTERBURN</h2>
<h3 class="power-level">Power Level: 7443</h3><h3 class="quote">"You, who has never trained a day in your life, will never defeat me. I was not born with skills or talent. I was born weak, but through hard work and training, I presevered. Just because you were born more fortunate than I am does not make you better than me. I will destroy that messed up illusion of yours. I WILL DEFEAT YOU AND PROVE THAT HARD WORK WILL PREVAIL OVER TALENT."</h3>

Zetterburn is the protagonist of this anime. Similar to other shonens, the protagonist starts out weak. Actually he didn't even start out that weak, Zetterburn's punish and neutral game has always been INSANE. But the competition is tough, as his skills pale in comparison to monsters like Wrastor and Maypul. In addition, when Zetterburn first started training, he somehow completely forgot about recovery. But secretly from the shadows, he has been powering up and learning new techniques. His Down B evolved to new heights, and I mean that *literally*. It now now gives him some height and a push forward, while also refreshing his double jump. When people think of Zetterburn, they remember the weakling of last year who could never recover. But the Zetterburn today is now a completely different Zetterburn than the one you knew last year. No one expects him to have improved so much -- to be this strong, and that surprise factor is what makes him so dangerous, which is why he is ranked so high. Do not underestimate this one at all.



<h2 class="character spacing">ORCANE</h2>
<h3 class="power-level">Power Level: 7329</h3><h3 class="quote">"Hey Zetterburn, want to have a friendly spar?"</h3>

When you think of the "Big 3" of the school, you always would think of Wrastor, Maypul, and Orcane. But lately, things have been getting weird. Wrastor and Maypul both diligently worked hard and got scholarships to the best universities, but Orcane... he just fell off In the past couple months, his gameplay did not evolve at all. He is just *stale*. But I have high hopes for Orcane. His base power level, his inner talent, his potential are all so high. In fact, when he was first born, his power level was 6900. On paper, his kit and his frame data are all absolutely incredible. He was called a prodigy, and everyone expected him to be the star of the nation. So why is it that his power level is only 7329 right now? It's simple, because he has never actually trained a single day in his life. That's right folks, he is the Frieza of this anime. Frieza only had to train for a couple months to achieve his Golden Frieza form, which rivaled Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan (Super Saiyan Blue) Goku. The moment he starts trying, he will shock the world with his raw power. But as of right now, I cannot in good consciousness rank him any higher, as this is a "current meta" tier list instead of a theoretical potential one.


<h2 class="character spacing">FORSBURN</h2>
<h3 class="power-level">Power Level: 7214</h3><h3 class="quote">"I can quit smoking anytime I want"</h3>

Forsburn was once the star of the anime with the highest power level, but today Forsburn is the least popular character in the show. But it would be unwise to correlate popularity with power level. Although at the lowest point in his life, Forsburn can still hold his own against even the "Big 3". He has gone through many evolutions in the past couple months, and is still trying to find his identity. I have no doubt that when he finds it, he will reclaim his former glory again.

<hr class="hr">

<h1 class="tier">**Tier B**:</h1>

<h2 class="character">KRAGG</h2>
<h3 class="power-level">Power Level:  6333</h3><h3 class="quote">"So I'm just choosing to spam Down B and Rocks because it's working against you. I can, um, totally play in a not lame way too."</h3>

Ah.. Kragg, Kragg, Kragg, my old friend. He is the epitome of mediocrity. His technique, his ki, his power level, his recovery, his edgeguard. All of them are just mediocre. He's not *bad*, y'know. A power level of 6333 is great! Respectable, even. I'm sure if he was given his own anime, or if he was born in different times, he would be the star of the show. But this isn't an alternate universe. This is the world of Aether, and compared to the other Rivals, he is simply subpar. You have nothing to fear from this Rival.


<h2 class="character spacing">ABSA</h2>
<h3 class="power-level">Power Level: 5912</h3><h3 class="quote">"I thought I was a good character :("</h3>

Finally, we have Absa who is last on this tier list. Now, don't get me wrong -- Absa is by no means weak. She has amazing mobility and mixups with her Up B, her sweetspot aerials are incredibly strong, and she she has a godlike projectile. So what prompted me to put Absa below even a pillar of mediocrity like Kragg? Well, go take a look at tournament placings for competitive tournaments like RCS. We usually see plenty of "The Big 3" in top 8, and usually they are actually the tournament winner or runner-up. Every other week, we see the Tier A heroes in top 8. Even Kragg, represented by MSB, Failwhale, and AZCards, is not uncommon in top 8. But where's Absa? She's simply not even on the list; Absa literally is never in top 8. Despite her great kit, she unfortunately just does not place well, and as consequence deserves the last place spot.

Thank you for reading my tier list. Keep in mind that this tier list, along with every other tier list, is subjective. It should be used only as a reference for the meta, and does not take into account the potential of characters. And like every other anime, raw power level is not as important as the actual usages of powers.
