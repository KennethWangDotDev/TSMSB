Gravity jump is a double jump that sends absa DOWNWARDS. It's pretty simple in its execution.

**1**. Make sure you're STANDING ON A PLATFORM

**2**. Drop down from the platform and as soon as you drop from the platform, press the jump button while STILL HOLDING DOWNWARDS

**3**. It is optional to waveland on the platform to start it up.

**PROS:**
* It gives absa slightly more horizontal aerial mobility when dropping from platform
* Can be followed up any time with an aerial
* Fall speed is reduced compared to fastfall

**CONS:**
* This tech is very DANGEROUS, if you get hit out of gravity jump then you will have no double jump.
* If you get hit offstage, then you'll have one less recovery option, use this tech wisely.
