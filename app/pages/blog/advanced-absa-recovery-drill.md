To execute this Merchant Port drill, we first have to start on either of the platforms towards the edge of the stage.

**1.** Make absolute sure that you are above the platform near the ledge, or at least have a double jump, airdodge, or cloud hop that you can use to get above the platform near the ledge.

**2.** Now that you're above the platform, angle your first zip of up special completely horizontal towards the platform near the edge of the stage. By the end of your first zip, you should be above the platform and in the center of it as well.

**3.** Angle the second zip of up special diagonally down towards the edge of the platform in order to ledge cancel the up special.

**4.** Now that you've edge cancelled your first up special, execute another up speical, aiming it diagonally upwards towards the platform nearest to you with the anchor on it. By the end of your zip, you should be above the platform, but somewhat near the center of it.

**5.** Angle your second zip of upspecial diagonally down towards the edge of the platform in order to perform another ledge cancel.

**6.** Now that you've ledge cancelled your second up special, execute a third up special completely horizontally towards the opposite side of the stage where you started from.

**7.** Angle the second zip of up special diagonally down towards the edge of the stage in order to maximize distance from your opponent.

This technique is extremely useful because if you're being edgeguarded, you can potentially use this up special route in order to literally land on the other side of the stage and set up your cloud, or hit them with a fitilt.(edited)
