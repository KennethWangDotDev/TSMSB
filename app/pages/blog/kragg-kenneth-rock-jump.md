This is a cool mobility option for Kragg that makes use of the horizontal momentum gained from walljumping.. When chained with an aerial, it can be used as a surprising mixup for the neutral game.

<ul style="list-style: none!important">
<li><strong>1.</strong> Make a Rock.</li>
<li><strong>2.</strong> Go near the edge of a platform.</li>
<li><strong>3.</strong> Jump high enough to go over the platform.</li>
<li><strong>4.</strong> Down throw the rock near the edge of the platform. Note that the down throw will give you a bit of extra height.</li>
<li><strong>4.</strong> Position yourself to walljump on the rock as you fall. Hold your movement stick towards the direction of the rock. When you are at the center of the rock, press the jump button to walljump off it.</li>
</ul>

Note that it's possible to walljump off the rock even if it is not at the center of the platform. However, it is a 1 frame trick and is extremely difficult. You can also walljump off the rock on your double jump for further timing mixups.
