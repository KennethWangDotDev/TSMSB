<h2 style="margin-top:3rem!important">Dash Attack Jump-Cancel</h2>

Etalus's ability to jump-cancel his Dash Attack is the foundation of his gameplay. It greatly enhances his neutral game by allowing Etalus more mobility and mixup options. The Dash Attack can be jump-cancelled into nair, fair, bair, reverse-bair, and more. Etalus can also jump-cancel it into a wavedash, letting him go quickly from one point to another. In addition, the wavedash can be a wavedash in place, allowing him to use his grounded moves such as his jab combo or dtilt. 

The jump-cancelled Dash Attack also serves as a timing mixup for offensive moves, since he can choose to either hit the opponent with the Dash Attack and then cancel it into another attack, or to simply cancel it into another attack at any point during the move.

<h2>Ice Waveland</h2>

Etalus is able to go farther when wavelanding and sliding off a platform covered in ice.

<h2>Long Jump</h2>

By dash attacking before jumping, Etalus gains speed and goes farther.

<h2>Mobile Smashes</h2>

Etalus is able to charge a smash while in motion by via the *Wavesmash*, *Gatling*, or *DACUS*.

* **Wavesmash:** On ice, dash attack cancel into a wavedash, and then immediately charge a smash. You should slide on the ice while charging the smash.
* **DACUS:** DACUS stands for Dash Attack Cancel Up Smash. At any point of the dash attack, you can do the input for an upsmash to DACUS.
* **Gatling:** After Etalus's Dash Attack hits an opponent, he can immediately do an upsmash. This is called the Gatling.

<h2>Up-B Into Waveland</h2>

This is a minor and situational mobility option for Etalus. It is possible to do this while offstage when recovering, but the frame window to waveland from offstage to stage is extremely tiny.
