This is a fairly simple Absa tech and mobility option that you may find useful.

Execution is as follows:

**1.** Neutral special so that you get the cloud hop

**2.** As soon as you neutral special, wavedash (airdodge) diagonally down. 

**3.** (Optional) Detonate cloud so you can add a hitbox in front/behind you

This tech is mainly used for the cloud waveland variant, where you cloud wavedash on a platform in case you don't have a double jump and you want to quickly get on platform without up-special endlag.
