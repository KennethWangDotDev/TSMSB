A player is frozen in a CPU Etalus's ice prison.


The CPU Etalus is programmed to randomly and blindly tech chase one of the three tech options on the very last frame, the options being left, right, or in place. The Etalus will always do this regardless of the player's position or inputs. The player is in the center of the stage, and the Etalus can **only** cover one of the three options.


There's a twist though, the player is ceztellz and his mom is going to ground him so he needs to SD as fast as possible, so **he wants to get hit by the Etalus.**


The player chooses to tech a direction, let's say tech left. The game is paused, and then Dan Fornace reveals to the player that Etalus will not tech chase one of the other remaining options, for example, say, tech in place. Dan then gives the offer to let the player switch his tech choice.


**Problem: In order to maximize the chances of getting hit by the CPU Etalus's tech read, should the player stay teching left or should he switch to the remaining choice. Or is it the same probability either way?**
