<h2 class="margin-top">Movement Drill</h2>

To execute this Absa movement Merchant Port drill, we first have to start on either of the platforms towards the edge of the stage.

**1.** Angle your first zip up special diagonally upwards towards the platform with the anchor on it.

**2.** You should be above the first platform now. Then, angle your second zip of up special diagonally downwards, towards the edge of the first platform. This allows for the up special to be ledge cancelled, and you should be able to act freely out of it.

**3.**  Now that you can up special again, do another up special, but have the first zip of this one be angled completely horizontal, towards the platform opposite of where you started from (the platform near the ledge.)

**4.** Finally, angle the second zip of up special diagonally downwards towards the edge of the platform near the ledge in order to land on the other side of the stage!

This technique is very useful to get out of bad situations, or to stall in situations where your opponent has respawn invincibility(edited)

**1.** Make absolute sure that you are above the platform near the ledge, or at least have a double jump, airdodge, or cloud hop that you can use to get above the platform near the ledge.

**2.** Now that you're above the platform, angle your first zip of up special completely horizontal towards the platform near the edge of the stage. By the end of your first zip, you should be above the platform and in the center of it as well.

**3.** Angle the second zip of up special diagonally down towards the edge of the platform in order to ledge cancel the up special.

**4.** Now that you've edge cancelled your first up special, execute another up speical, aiming it diagonally upwards towards the platform nearest to you with the anchor on it. By the end of your zip, you should be above the platform, but somewhat near the center of it.

**5.** Angle your second zip of upspecial diagonally down towards the edge of the platform in order to perform another ledge cancel.

**6.** Now that you've ledge cancelled your second up special, execute a third up special completely horizontally towards the opposite side of the stage where you started from.

**7.** Angle the second zip of up special diagonally down towards the edge of the stage in order to maximize distance from your opponent.

This technique is extremely useful because if you're being edgeguarded, you can potentially use this up special route in order to literally land on the other side of the stage and set up your cloud, or hit them with a fitilt.(edited)
